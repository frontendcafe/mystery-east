## **Intro**

To have a level playing field for developers with and without React experience, we ask that you bootstrap your project with **"Create React App"** (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a starter kit that does all scaffolding and basic setup for a basic React application.

### Objective

We would like to see a web application with at least two pages (routes): a details page for the TV show "Seinfeld", and an episode detail page with information about each episode in particular.

The TV show page should at least display the following information (you're free to add more):

- Show title
- Show Description
- Show poster of the show
- Episode list.

Every episode in the list should link to a details page for that specific episode, where the following information can be found:

- Episode title
- Episode Summary
- Episode cover image
- Duration
- Date

We would like to see an application with at least a page for one specific show: "Seinfeld" (feel free to add more). 

As an example of how a TV show page might look, you can refer to the following examples in order to get some inspiration:

- [http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/530/seinfeld](http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/530/seinfeld)
- [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/)

### API

The data for the app should be retrieved from the TV Maze API ([http://www.tvmaze.com/api](http://www.tvmaze.com/api)).

### **Design**

The look and feel of the application is completely up to the developers, and we will not judge your design skills. 

But there are a few things that we would like you to use:

- Use CSS to style your components. We encourage you to use pre-processors such as Sass.
- The site should be responsive with at least ONE break-point in your CSS. (mobile and desktop view should be fine)

### **Deliverables**

Push the source code into a public Git repository

Any git flow is allowed, but we expect the end result to be in the main branch.

Your app should run in localhost, and in the documentation we expect to see:

- The steps should be described in the main README.me file of the application.
- Decisions that were take during the process among future improvements.

### **Other considerations**

- Adding automatic tests is always a good idea, but not a requirement.
- Browser Compatibility: All modern browsers.

### **Summary**

- Use React to render UI components.
- Use "Create React App" to initiate your project .
- Setup at least two routes in your app, one for TV shows and one for episodes.

- Retrieve data from TV Maze REST API
- Style your components with CSS, make sure that the end result is responsive and has at least for web and mobile.
- Source code should be available in a Git repository
- Documentation is optional but appreciated, the same goes for comments in your code
